DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING: find overlapping subproblems and store results so they don't have to
be calculated again and thus greatly speeding up time complexity 
MEMOIZATION or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer 
programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result 
when the same inputs occur again.

Memoization Problem Solving Tips (recursive): 
    1. draw out as tree structure, visualize it
    2. find subproblems, found in nodes in drawn tree
    3. find base cases, found in leaf nodes or similar
    4. find brute force solution using recursion
    5. convert brute force to memoization solution using recursion

Tabulation Problem Solving Tips (iterative):
    1. visualize the problem as a table
    2. find size of the table is based on inputs
    3. initialize the table with default values
    4. seed the trivial answer into the table
    5. iterate through table
    6. fill further positions based on the current position
